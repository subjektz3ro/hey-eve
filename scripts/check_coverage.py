"""Per-file coverage floors, because the average hides the risk.

A single repo-wide number is the wrong instrument for this project. Roughly
half the source is four framebuffer renderers that need a panel to exercise
honestly, and the other half is the part where a mistake is silent: the wake
matcher that decides whether speech was addressed to you, the memory store
that has to survive a power cut mid-write, the pacing maths that decides
whether a reply gaps audibly. Averaging lets the second group rot behind the
first group's mass.

So: every file must meet `default`, and anything that cannot yet is listed
explicitly in `[tool.coverage-floors.exceptions]` with the number it actually
achieves. The list IS the debt register. Adding a file to it is a deliberate
act that shows up in review; letting a file drift below its own floor fails.
